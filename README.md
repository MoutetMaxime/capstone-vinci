# Capstone Project (Vinci) : Optimising the positioning of charging points for electric vehicles 

## Description
In this work, we tackled the complex problem of electrical vehicle charging stations
placement. Focusing on a specific city, La Baule-Escoublac, our approach followed two parallel
paths. In the first one, we tried to estimate the demand of charging stations from users. We
conducted a thorough data analysis, allowing us to calculate two distinct types of demand: the
first based on the number of electric vehicle owners, and the second on energy needs estimated
from the populationâ€™s travel patterns. In the second path, we implemented different algorithm to
solve the NP-hard optimization problem of placing the stations. We used two approach, a greedy
and a genetic one. Our final results are consistent with already existing stations and profit values.

## Repository Structure

- **data_exploration/**: Contains notebooks for initial data exploration.
- **data_visualisation/**: Contains notebooks dedicated to creating visuals used in reports and presentations.
- **demand_estimation/**: Contains scripts and notebooks for estimating demand and saving the results.
- **model/**: Holds the classes implementing the algorithms and the scripts to run them.
- **data/**: Stores raw, preprocessed, and processed data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- **Demand Estimation**: Execute the scripts in `demand_estimation/` to compute and save demand estimation.
- **Modeling**: Define data source after demand estimation and run algorithms from `model/`.
